Antithesis
==========

__A Static Web Site Generator for Windows written in .NET__

Inspired by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/),
*Antithesis* generates static HTML sites from simple, human managable files
and is ideal for simple content sites, and blogs.

Why?
----

I develop on the Windows Platform and in .NET, and I wanted a static site
generator for my blog and web sites. 

The popular tools are mostly written in Ruby and can be hard to get going
for the novice under Windows, so I resolved to create one, by borrowing some 
of the best ideas and re-casting it into a Windows tool.

So what good is a static site?
------------------------------

A static HTML site can be deployed on any web server on any platform and 
has no dependencies. 

It is very fast to serve and therefore scales well, secure, and ultimately 
the content is easily portable to other generators or even other CMS systems
if your needs change.

It allows the content author to concentrate on the content, not the code or 
maintenance of the system.
