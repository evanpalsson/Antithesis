__A Forex Trading Tool using the OANDA API__

After playing with a number of Forex APIs in the past, I found out 
recently that OANDA have released a new modern RESTful/JSON API!

Finally, a sensible step forward into the 21st century!

This has inspired me to build the *Antithesis* browser based trading tool.

Why?
----

I have been studying Forex for a number of years in bursts between
other things. I found that I was unhappy with the tools available that
most traders use because they are focused on indicators, analysis, news etc. 
All of which I find distracting. 

I utilise a simple price action methodology, trading from mostly the daily charts.
I want to maintain a process where I analyse the markets I'm following each day,
keeping records and reviewing them. I could do this with a note pad and pen, but
I'm a software engineer, so I want to do it on my computer, and keep it all together.

Therefore I decided to build this browser based trading tool. It will also help me
learn more about AngularJS.

Features
--------

I am working to deliver the following (mostly for my own benefit). If you want to help, 
let me know!

* Browser based, modern AngularJS application
* Sign into your OANDA Practice or Trade account, showing details and open positions
* Risk/Reward calculator focused on value, not pips, and trade placement.
* Configure a set of instruments you are interested in
* Simple, clean and basic charting suitable for price action trading with a set of global
options applying to all instruments, configurable by period (1D,4H,1H, etc)
** Simple Moving Averages
** Exponential Moving Averages
** Colours
* Record chart configuration per period (1D, 4H, 1H), allowing review of your 
previous analysis, forming a comprehensive trade diary.
** Simple way to mark support and resistance levels
** Analysis Notes
** Ability to project support and resistance levels between time frames
